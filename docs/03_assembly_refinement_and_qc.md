# 03 — Assembly Refinement & QC

**Goal:** improve contiguity, inspect the circular genome, separate chromosome/plasmid, and assess quality/completeness.
**Tools:** MeDuSa v1.0, RagTag v2.1, Proksee/CGView, CLC Genomics Workbench v24.0, PlasFlow (@ Galaxy), QUAST, BUSCO v5.7.1.

## 3.1 Scaffolding — MeDuSa v1.0

Scaffold the SPAdes contigs against the closest reference (*B. nitratireducens* **BM02**, complete genome).

```bash
# MeDuSa is a Java tool (install from https://github.com/combogenomics/medusa)
java -jar medusa.jar \
  -i results/spades_LABIM53/contigs.fasta \
  -f data/reference_genomes/ \
  -o results/medusa_LABIM53.fasta \
  -v
```

**Reported outcome:** 425 → **300 contigs**.

## 3.2 Reference-guided scaffolding & gap fill — RagTag v2.1

```bash
ragtag.py scaffold \
  data/reference_genomes/B_nitratireducens_BM02.fasta \
  results/medusa_LABIM53.fasta \
  -o results/ragtag_LABIM53
```

**Reported outcome:** 300 → **276 contigs**.

## 3.3 Circular visualisation & gap analysis — Proksee / CGView → **Figure 1**

- Upload the scaffolded assembly to **Proksee** (https://proksee.ca) / CGView.
- Compare against **12** *B. nitratireducens* genomes (GenBank) to identify gaps to close.
- This comparison is the basis of **Figure 1** (rings: GC content, GC skew, ORFs, and the 12 comparison genomes).

## 3.4 Manual gap closure — CLC Genomics Workbench v24.0 (GUI, commercial)

Remaining gaps were closed manually.
**Reported final assembly:** **36 scaffolds**, total **5,671,654 bp**, largest scaffold 5,190,595 bp, **L50 = 1**, **G+C = 35.2%**. The scaffold count is an assembly statistic; it must not be restated as a definitive count of physical chromosomes or plasmids.

## 3.5 Chromosome/plasmid prediction — PlasFlow (@ Galaxy) → **Table 1**

- Run **PlasFlow** on the Galaxy web platform (https://usegalaxy.org) with the final contigs.
- Output: a per-scaffold **predicted** class (chromosome-associated, plasmid-associated or unclassified) and taxonomic signal (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria or unclassified) → **Table 1**.
- Treat these labels as classifier predictions, not as confirmation of replicon structure.
- `tables/Table_1_PlasFlow_classifications.tsv` was extracted from the supplied manuscript and contains 34 rows (4 chromosome-labelled and 30 plasmid-labelled predictions; 5,669,186 bp). The Results text reports 36 scaffolds (5 chromosome-labelled and 31 plasmid-labelled; 5,671,654 bp), so two rows totalling 2,468 bp are absent from the manuscript table.
- Because the original PlasFlow output is unavailable, retain the extracted table and this discrepancy statement. Do not manufacture the two missing rows or present either class count as a physical replicon count.

## 3.6 Quality & completeness — QUAST + BUSCO v5.7.1

```bash
quast.py results/ragtag_LABIM53/ragtag.scaffold.fasta \
  -o results/quast_LABIM53 -t <threads>

busco -i results/ragtag_LABIM53/ragtag.scaffold.fasta \
  -m genome -l bacillales_odb10 \
  -o LABIM53_busco -c <threads>
```

**Reported outcome (BUSCO, n = 124):** 100.0% complete (96.0% single-copy, 4.0% duplicated), 0.0% fragmented, 0.0% missing.
